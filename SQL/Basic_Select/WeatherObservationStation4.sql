/*

Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of 
distinct CITY entries in the table.
The STATION table is described as follows:

[Station.jpg]

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

For example, if there are three records in the table with CITY values 'New York', 
'New York', 'Bengalaru', there are 2 different city names: 'New York' and 'Bengalaru'. 
The query returns 1, because :

total numbers of records - number of unique city names = 3 - 2 = 1 

*/

select count(city) - (select count(distinct city) from station) as resultado from station;
